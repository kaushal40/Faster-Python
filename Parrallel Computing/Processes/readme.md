**Processes**

- Allows usage of all the cores 

- If you use multiple processes you need to do IPC (inter process communication which is expensive)


**How to run**

- `ipython`

- `run proc_pool.py`

- `time _ = unpack(requests)`

- `prun unpack(requests)` // see where code is spending most of the time

- `run proc_pool.py`

- `time _ = unpack_proc(requests)`

**Use Ipython and timeit function to see the average time for all functions in examples**

- install ipython `pip install ipython`

- Run `ipyhton` 

- Here I have taken example form *PIcking data structure/Deque*

- Run `run tasks.py` to run the python code you want to run 

- Run `timeit test_queue(1000)`  to time the function execution
